Description: Fit generalized linear models with binomial responses
    using either an adjusted-score approach to bias reduction or
    maximum penalized likelihood where penalization is by Jeffreys
    invariant prior. These procedures return estimates with improved
    frequentist properties (bias, mean squared error) that are always
    finite even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are
    infinite (data separation). Fitting takes place by fitting
    generalized linear models on iteratively updated pseudo-data. The
    interface is essentially the same as 'glm'.  More flexibility is
    provided by the fact that custom pseudo-data representations can be
    specified and used for model fitting. Functions are provided for
    the construction of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias
    estimates.
